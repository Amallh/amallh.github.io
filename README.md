In this study, the focus is on developing a robust methodology for automatic
segmentation of infected lung regions in COVID-19 CT scans utilizing advanced CNNs. The
proposed model is based on a modified U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms, data
augmentation, and postprocessing techniques, achieving high segmentation accuracy and
boundary precision. The dataset was sourced from publicly available repositories, processed,
and augmented to increase its diversity and generalizability. The approach was evaluated
quantitatively, resulting in a Dice coefficient of 0.8658 and mean IoU of 0.8316. The proposed
model is compared to existing methods through comparative analysis, clearly demonstrating its
superiority in handling data variability and achieving precise segmentation. Future work involves
expanding the dataset, applying an alternative 3D segmentation approach, and improving the
model for clinical deployment.
